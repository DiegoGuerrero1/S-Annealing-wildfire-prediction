# Simulated S-Annealing-wildfire-prediction

The algorithm searches for a maxima of wildfire spread on a given 3D surface. Takes into count the temperature and wind
speed to predict the optimal point in which the fire will reach a maxima. 
![Four maxima (pink circles)](https://github.com/DiegoGuerrero1/S-Annealing-wildfire-prediction/blob/9aa3d676e5a3adf1fa905b00027b18622178fa7d/figures/Figure_4.png)
Four maxima (pink circles)
